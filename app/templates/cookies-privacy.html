        <p><strong>Measuring website usage (Google Analytics)</strong></p>

        <p>We use Google Analytics software to collect information about how you use
            this service. We do this to help make sure the site is meeting the needs of
            its users and to help us make improvements, for example improving site
            search.</p>

        <p>Google Analytics stores information about:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The pages you visit</li>
            <li>How long you spend on each page</li>
            <li>How you got to the site</li>
            <li>What you click on while you’re visiting the site</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We don’t use Google Analytics to collect or store your personal information
            (for example your name or address).</p>

        <p>The information we collect through our cookies does not include personal
            details such as your name, age, telephone number, postal address or email
            address, nor does it allow personal identification of a user.</p>

        Why we collect your data
    </h2>

    <p>The Survey Data Collection service is used as the online collection mechanism for a number of our surveys. More
        surveys will be offered via this service over time.</p>
    <p>Individual survey teams are responsible for the content (the questions asked) of their respective surveys. Survey Data Collection
        does need some personal data in its own right for the functioning of the platform.</p>
    <p>UK legislation allows us to collect and process your data to produce statistics
        for the public good. Your information will be treated as confidential by the
        Code of Practice for Official Statistics.</p>


    <h2 class="neptune u-mt-l">
        When we collect your data
    </h2>

    <p>Your data is collected when:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>you and sign in to the ONS Surveys platform</li>
        <li>you complete a survey</li>
        <li>you contact us by any means</li>
        <li>you visit a website that comprises the Survey Data Collection platform</li>

                            able to talk to another (e.g. the Survey Data Collection web site) over the internet.</p>
